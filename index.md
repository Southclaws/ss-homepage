# Scavenge and Survive

![tent campfire](imgs/TentCampfire.jpg)

Scavenge and Survive is a San Andreas Multiplayer server mod, a PvP survival
game where everyone is pitched against each other. Supplies are scarce and
everyone is willing to kill for the same goals! Safety in numbers is key to
survival, but trust is hard to find.

The game is run by the players. All rules and events are determined by players,
not staff or devs.
